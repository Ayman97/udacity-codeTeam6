                  <span>
                    The git rebase command is used to do a great many things.<br>
                    Inside the interactive list of commits, all commits start out as pick, but you can swap that out with one of the other commands (reword, edit, squash, fixup, exec, and drop).<br>
                    I recommend that you create a backup branch before rebasing, so that it's easy to return to your previous state. If you're happy with the rebase, then you can just delete the backup branch!

              <ul>
                <li>Before you start doing any work<br> 
                  <span>
                    make sure to look for the project's CONTRIBUTING.md file.
                    Next, it's a good idea to look at the GitHub issues for the project
                    look at the existing issues to see,
                    if one is similar to the change you want to contribute
                    if necessary create a new issue
                    communicate the changes you'd like to make to the project maintainer in the issue
                    When you start developing, commit all of your work on a topic branch:<br>
                    do not work on the master branch<br>
                    make sure to give the topic branch clear, descriptive name<br>
                    As a general best practice for writing commits:<br>
                    make frequent, smaller commits<br>
                    use clear and descriptive commit messages
                    update the README file, if necessary
                  </span>
                </li>
                <li>Fork a repository<br>
                  <span>
                    Forking is an action that's done on a hosting service, like GitHub. Forking a repository creates an identical copy of the original repository and moves this copy to your account. You have total control over this forked repository. Modifying your forked repository does not alter the original repository in any way.
                  </span>
                </li>

                </li>
                <li>pull request<br>
                  <span>A pull request is a request for the source repository to pull in your commits and merge them with their project. To create a pull request, a couple of things need to happen:<br>
                  you must fork the source repository<br>
                  clone your fork down to your machine<br>
                  make some commits (ideally on a topic branch!)<br>
                  push the commits back to your fork<br>
                  create a new pull request and choose the branch that has your new commits
                  <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull">more</a>
                  </span>
                </li>
                <li>You just created a pull request! Congratulations<br>
                  <span>
                    As you can see, it's actually not too difficult to create a pull request. When I was first learning Git, GitHub, and how to collaborate, I was extremely nervous about making commits, and working with remote repos, but especially submitting a pull request to another developer's project! As long as you following the steps we covered in the previous section on:<br>
                    reviewing the project's CONTRIBUTING.md file<br>
                    checking out the project's existing issues<br>
                    talking with the project maintainer<br>
